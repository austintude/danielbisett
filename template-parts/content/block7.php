                                        I love working remotely because it means my family and I can travel across the US and Canada without having to lose a steady income.

                            <br>
                            It took hours and hours to teach my ears to hear the sounds and my tongue to make them.

                            In less than two weeks, when we finally stepped off our last boat onto the shores of Belem, the locals considered me a proficient speaker and the customs agents who had given our neighbors grief about the contraband they were carrying, were very pleasant and let my girlfriend and I through without a hitch.
